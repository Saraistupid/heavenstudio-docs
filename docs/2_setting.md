# Setting up Heaven Studio

Heaven Studio is currently in a beta state, and we do not have any public releases as of right now. We currently have nightly builds that you can grab from our GitHub Actions, but support is not guaranteed. Please select your operating system accordingly:

- [Windows](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/build/master/StandaloneWindows64-build.zip)
- [MacOS](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/build/master/StandaloneOSX-build.zip)
- [Linux](https://nightly.link/RHeavenStudio/HeavenStudio/workflows/build/master/StandaloneLinux64-build.zip)

There's also prerelease/alpha builds for Release 1, which are more stable but are missing some experimental features from the nightly branch:
